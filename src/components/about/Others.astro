  <h3>More about me...</h3>
  <p>I speak தமிழ் (Tamil) and English.</p>

  <p>
    I love challenging myself with new activities and am currently into jump
    rope and bodyweight training as part of my fitness routine.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not coding or working out, I’m hanging out with my cute
    co-worker—my dog, Dolly 🐶, who would probably trade me for a Jumbone!
