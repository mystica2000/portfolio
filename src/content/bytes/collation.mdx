Collation in Database is the set of rules to govern how characters are searched, compared and sorted in the database.
It includes case sensitivity, accent-sensitivity and storing multi-lingual, emojis, special characters.
It is mostly applicable for string datatypes (TEXT, VARCHAR) than others.

Why this is important? because every database treats the characters in a unique way.

Like,

- MySQL don't support case sensitive search out of box (can be configured to do so).
- Postgres, SQLite includes it out of box.

Databases allows us to specify collation on the time of

- creation of the db or table
- specify per query, per column basis.

_For example_:

In MySQL, if you want to perform search by case sensitive,

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM names WHERE username = "TesT"; // returns "test", "Test", "tESt"
```

The default character encoding for MySQL is `utf8mb4_general_ci` (MySQL 5.7) or `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (MySQL 8.0)

where,

- `utf8mb` - full unicode support in which it occupied 4bytes. (Note: `utf8` is different from `utf8mb4`, `utf8` lacks support for all unicode characters. it is not longer recommeded)
- `ci` - refers to case insensitive
- `ai` - accent insensitive

To make our query aware, we can set collation to `utf8mb4_unicode_cs` or `utf8mb4_bin` or another case-sensitive collation.

where,

- `cs` - case sensitive
- `bin` - binary (compares byte by byte, no other rules)

To perform query aware case sensitive search:

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM names WHERE username COLLATE utf8mb4_bin = "TesT";
SELECT * FROM names WHERE username COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_cs = "TesT";
```

Collation plays a important role in dealing with multilingual databases effectively for making search, sorting operations consistent with lingustic rules. It is mostly decided at the time of initializing the database.
