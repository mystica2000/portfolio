To add fallback for styles in iOS devices - mobile

```css
@supports (-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch) {
  /* css classes/selectors */
}
```

For example: `background-attachment: fixed` don't work in safari mobile, add fallback for mobile iOS like

```css
@supports (-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch) {
  body {
    /*switch to scroll which is default - iOS mobile*/
    background-attachment: scroll;
  }
}
```
