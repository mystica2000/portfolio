Listed down the number of ways to transmit/exchange data between server and browser, we might use:

- traditional way (http request/response)
- chunked-response (streams data)
- SSE (streams - text only, base64)
- Web Sockets (streams)
- grpc web (needs proxy)
- Web Transport (alternative to web sockets BUT major browser support is lacking - as of 2024)

send/recv data between browser to browser itself (new tab/window/browser/remote browser)

- Broadcast Channel
- Webrtc Data Channel (text/blob), Webrtc Media stream (audio/video/screen sharing) - p2p
- MessageChannel (iframe to main, main thread to workers, tabs, window and vice versa)
- PostMessage (iframe to main, main thread to workers, tabs, window and vice versa)
