**Ring Buffer/Circular Queue/Circular Buffer** is a data structure for effectively managing queueing for low latency/time critical tasks, overwriting the old value when the queue is full and wrapping around without needing for dynamic size allowing continuous flow of data.

A more advanced version of the ring buffer is all over the place. A few examples could be:

- **Device Drivers** use it as a transport between software and hardware components
- **io_uring** (used by linux kernel for async I/O) uses two ring buffers -- submission and completion queue to manage/signal I/O requests
- **Real-time stream and media processing** -- managing media on the buffer to be processed

At a lower level, locking and unlocking resources is expensive, which results in delays for performance-critical applications. To avoid this, a ring buffer **CAN BE** implemented as a lock-free data structure without needing to use mutex, semaphores.

Lock-free data structures are thread-safe for concurrent usage without having to use mutual exclusion mechanisms like semaphores or locks.

#### Concurrency Handling

- For a Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) setup, there is a less chance of data corruption since it's single producer and consumer. Although [atomic operations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/) can be designed to ensure correctness.
- For Multiple Producers Multiple Consumers (MPMC), additional techniques needs to be employed to combat data races since it is accessed by multiple threads. Atomic Operations, [Memory Barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier) or other techniques can be used.

There are different lock-free techniques available to ensure correctness and avoid corruption without explicit locking. The `io_uring` implementation uses memory ordering and barriers to get around without locking the shared memory.

A ring buffer in the shared memory enables inter-process communication (IPC) among different processes. It can act as a transporting mechanism between threads or user-kernel space.

Building Data Pipeline on top of Ring Buffer could result in **low latency, high performance message queue**.
