There are two types of concurrency in general.

1. co-operative
2. non-co-operative

### co-operative

<ImageView
  src={coop}
  alt="Co-operative
task#1 making  network call, what happens here is 'I can't processed
further until i get the network call returns'.  control goes to
the main (Event loop) where other tasks can be executed (task #2 here) without blocking

Event loop manages the state of async/await functions where it
checks if the network call is returned or not.

- If returned, then switches to task #1 and proceeds further next line(console.log)
- If not, nothing and continues to checks in the event loop until it is returned..
  meanwhile, other tasks are executed"
  />

Co-operative since the functions decides when they willingly to pause
by the using "await" and execute further instead of executing
at some arbitarty point (ie: flow would be disturbed if it executes
next lines of the code which depends on the result of the
network call arbitrarily instead of waiting on the network call)

- more like "concurrency on controlled manner"
- explicit yielding since we are explicitly using await keyword to pause

### Non co-operative

There's non co-operative concurrency where context switch happens arbitrary implicit yielding instead of explicitly yielding to execute (usage of await keyword means explicit yielding).

implicit yielding would be os threads/go routines where runtime scheduler handles the yielding internally without needing to `await` explicitly to control the concurrency ..

- more like "concurrency on unhinged manner"
- implicit yielding since it depends on how os system thread scheduling/go-routine handles it.
