Concurrency is illusion of parallelism. parallelism comes under concurrency techniques but it may execute concurrently but not necessarily in parallel. The actual execution (concurrent or parallel) depends on single-core or multi-core, os ability to manage threads etc.
In conclusion, all parallel programs are concurrent but not all concurrent programs are parallel..
