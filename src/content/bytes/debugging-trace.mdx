In javascript, `console.trace` is underrated debugging tool that helps to trace the caller function. `console.trace` prints out the stacktrace/call stack of the function call that will help to trace out the calling function.

For example: If there is a helper function that is used in several places in the complex codebase, using console.trace on the function helps to trace out the caller function when debugging.

```js
function sanitizeHtml() {
  console.trace("sanitize html");
}

sanitizeHtml(); // line 5
// ...
sanitizeHtml(); // line 7
// ...
sanitizeHtml(); // line 9
// ...
sanitizeHtml(); // line 11
```

```
VM1567:2 sanitize html
sanitizeHtml	@	VM1567:2
(anonymous)	@	VM1567:5 # line 5

VM1567:2 sanitize html
sanitizeHtml	@	VM1567:2
(anonymous)	@	VM1567:7 # line 7

VM1567:2 sanitize html
sanitizeHtml	@	VM1567:2
(anonymous)	@	VM1567:9 # line 9

VM1567:2 sanitize html
sanitizeHtml	@	VM1567:2
(anonymous)	@	VM1567:11 # line 11
```
