I've ported my site from 11ty to astro, some learnings to get started.

## Why Astro?

Astro is all in one framework for building static sites, it works with other libraries/frameworks. Although, i haven't used any frameworks along with it for the site.
It comes with out-of-box features which was more than enough to build the site.

## Init

```js
npm create astro@latest
```

It comes with typescript support and zod built-in for type safety

## Folder structure

```text
/
├── public/ # Static assets like favicon.svg and images that needs no optimization
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── assets/ # Processed and optimized images
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── components/ # Reusable components
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── content/ # Blog posts or static data
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── layouts/ # Page layouts
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages/ # Static and dynamic pages
│   │   └── ...
│   └── utils/ # Helper functions
│       └── ...
└── package.json
```

## Assets in public/ vs. src/assets

- `public` renders the image as such, performs no optimization and no processing
- `src/assets` renders the processed and optimized image by the astro itself, we don't need to use external plugins to perform the optimization for us.

<i>Note: images can be under any folder on src/ to be optimized</i>

Astro has `<Image /> from 'astro:assets'` component is optimized for CLS Score by setting width/height.
[more about handling images in astro...](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets)

## File Structure

Astro comes with `.astro` extension for the astro files.
The skeleton of the file looks like:

```astro
---
server side
---

<div> content </div>

<script>
  // client side js
</script>
```

## Routing

Astro follows file-based routing for the files under `src/pages`.
It has static as well as dynamic routes.

- static routes are for the pages with static contents. For this site, /about, /bytes, /home, /projects are static routes.
- dynamic routes are for the pages that it created during rendering. For this site, /posts route contains dynamic routes.

## Extending HTML Components MDX

## Config

`astro.config.mjs` contains the build configuration that can be used for adding plugins, integration, syntax Highlighting configuration etc.

## MDX Support

## Config.ts

## getCollection vs astro.glob

### Code Snippet Highlighting

Astro has built-in syntax hightlighter we can use by specifying the theme on the `astro.config.mjs` as follows:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      theme: "slack-dark",
      wrap: true,
    },
  },
});
```

For more themes: visit https://shiki.matsu.io/themes. set padding, margin for the `<pre>` and `<code>` for it to look more spacious.

```css
pre {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  overflow: auto;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

code {
  border-radius: 5px;
  direction: ltr;
  font-size: 15px;
}

pre > code {
  line-height: 1.5;
  word-break: normal;
  white-space: pre;
  word-spacing: normal;
  tab-size: 4;
}
```
